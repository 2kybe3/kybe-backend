## This is just a small list of things i wanna implement soon TM

- /canvas?q=smth endpoint 
    allows you to draw smth via the q parameter

    for example DE flag "BBB\nRRR\nYYY"

    gonna need to think about how to manage Bright Colors
    probably just YB where Y just checks the next char?

- /user/{login, register}

- /shorten and /redir/{link}
    for registered users
